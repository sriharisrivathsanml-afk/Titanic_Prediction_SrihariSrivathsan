# INTRODUCTION
This is  my first project in the realm of data science and machine learning. The project predicts whether an individual survived the Great Titanic Tragedy using various attributes. The dataset used is the infamous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

# UNDERSTANDING THE DATASETS
There are two datasets that are present in this project :

*   train.csv (contains 12 columns)
*   test.csv  (contains 11 columns - the Survived column is absent)

## DESCRIPTION OF EACH ATTRIBUTE
*   PassengerID - ID of the passenger travelling
*   Survived - Whether the particular person survived or not ( 0 or 1 )
*   PClass - The class of ticket purchased ( 1 , 2 , 3)
*   Name - Name of the passenger
*   Sex - Male or Female
*   Age
*   SibSp - no of siblings/spouses
*   Parch - Number of parents / children
*   Ticket - Ticket Number
*   Fare - Passenger fare in pounds
*   Cabin - Cabin Numbers
*   Embarked - The port in which the passenger boarded the Titanic Ship

# THE SOLUTION PROCESS 
* Load and Understand Data -> Preprocess Data -> Train ML models on data -> Select and tune the best model -> Test and Validate the model -> Deploy the Model -> Analyse Feature Importances
* Libraries used -> numpy , pandas , scikit - learn , matplotlib
