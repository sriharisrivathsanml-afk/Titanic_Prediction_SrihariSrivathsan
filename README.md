# Titanic_Prediction_SrihariSrivathsan
This is my first ML project after getting to know quite some info on Machine Learning and Data Science. While the code is not completely optimized , i have tried to maintain the workflow of data engineering .

I have actually trained a few model and selected the best of the lot . 

This model gave me an accuracy of 0.77272 while evaluating on the kaggle website , which is quite decent for a model with minimal overfitting. However , continuous improvements will be provided and saved as various versions of the model in the same repo (or a different one).

For understanding the code , please go through the comments and
