# Predictions on The Titanic Dataset
This is my first project in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. While the code isn’t fully optimized yet, I’ve tried to follow a typical data engineering workflow from start to finish.

The project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, class, gender, and fare.

I experimented with several models during development, but chose Logistic Regression for the final predictions since it delivered the best accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.77272 on Kaggle — a solid result with minimal overfitting.

Although Logistic Regression is currently the best performer, I’ll continue training and tuning other models to explore possible improvements. Each new version of the model will be saved for reference and comparison.

For convenience, I’ve also shared a Google Colab notebook that walks through the entire project in detail — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation.

This project is also a great starting point for beginners interested in understanding the end-to-end process of data analysis, feature preparation, and predictive modeling.
